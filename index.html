<h1><img src="./favicon.png" alt="bsteele.com icon" style="width: 4%; height: 4%"/>bsteeleMusicApp Tutorial</h1>
<p>This is a tutorial for the bsteeleMusicApp.
  See <a href="http://www.bsteele.com/bsteeleMusicApp/index.html">bsteeleMusicApp</a>.
  It's a web app designed to allow musicians to play and sing songs together easily.
  Think of it as karaoke with chords.
</p>
<p>The following is a hierarchical list of operations that you might see when running the app.
  Tutorial videos on features will be available as links.
</p>
<p>Note: It will be a while until we have a complete set of tutorials. So be patient but
  make suggestions.

<h1 id="Player">Player Screen</h1>
<div>This screen allows you to play the selected song.</div>
<ul>
  <li>Back arrow
    <div>Will send you back to the original page.</div>
  </li>
  <li>Song title in the menu bar
    <div>It's not obvious, but clicking the title, artist and cover artist
      in the menu bar will send you on a search for the song on YouTube.com.
      You will be responsible for working your way back to this page!
      Thanks to YouTube, I don't have enough tools at my end to make this any easier.

</ul>
<h1>Concepts</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Display
    <div>The display and its fonts seem a bit large.
      The whole presentation is designed to be readable on an HDTV 20 feet away.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li id="Leader_Follower"><a href="./video/concept_leader_follower.mp4">Leader/Follower</a>
    <div>
      <img src="./img/cloud_web_socket_server_leader_follower_20220129.png" alt="leader/follower diagram"/></div>
  </li>
  <li>Leader Follower Complications
    <div>Often times the leader/follower feature can get in the way.
      You can leave your tablet ready for the CJ studio, but when you try to use it at home,
      some features are missing since you are still a "follower."
      Check the Options host selection if this is the case.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Singers Requester</li>
</ul>
<h1>Other complications</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Use of the app on tablets
    <div>The application is intended to be used on a laptop or desktop.
      Typically on chrome but many other browsers will work.
    </div>
    <div>Most all functions of the app will work on most tablets.
      Complications can arise if:
      <ol>
        <li>The width of the tablet is not wide enough to display all the functions.
          Sometimes rotating the tablet can fix this.
        </li>
        <li>The operating system struggles to allow applications, in this case the browser, to work with files.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Use of the app on cell phones
    <div>This can function, but the app struggles to display anything reasonable on such a small screen.</div>
  </li>
  <li>Audio
    <div>Unfortunately the audio features of the app are only available on the web (browser) platform.</div>
  </li>
  <li>Native versions
    <div>The app is typically used as a web browser application, but there are other formats that the app
      is available in.
      See: Options, About, "Download the app".
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Beta Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li><a href="./video/singer_playlist_bunching.mp4">Singers play list bunching</a></li>
  <li>Sheet Music Screen
    <div>This screen has actually been around for a long time.
      Choose a song, edit the song, select "Sheet Music."
      The top of the screen is meant to be a representation of a bass guitar.
      Place the mouse over the sheet music on the bottom and try scrolling!
    </div>
